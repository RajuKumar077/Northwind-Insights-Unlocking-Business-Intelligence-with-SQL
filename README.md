# 📊 Northwind Insights: Unlocking Business Intelligence with SQL

Welcome to **Northwind Insights** — a structured SQL project built on the classic Northwind database. This project simulates a real-world business scenario and answers critical business questions using powerful SQL queries. The goal is to demonstrate how structured data can be transformed into actionable insights for decision-makers.

## 🚀 Project Overview

In this project, we explore the **Northwind sample database**, which contains data related to a company’s product sales, orders, customers, suppliers, employees, and shipping.  
Using **SQL in DBeaver**, we extract valuable insights by writing optimized queries and visualizing relational patterns across multiple tables.
